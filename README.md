# Șeptică

It is a cards game of which I found several variations. The current variation is the romania version.

## How to run?
To run it just run:

    $ git clone https://github.com/claudiu-persoiu/septica.git
    $ cd septica
    $ go run main.go

The game will start on port 8008 and you can access it in a browser at http://localhost:8008

## How to play?
The game cat be played in 2 to 4 players, so find several partners to play with.

To start, the first player will put down a card. The other players can "cut" the hand with a similar card of different color or with a 7.

If there is a game of 3 players, 8 is also a cut, like the 7.


The last cut will take the cards and be the first to start the next round. If there was no cut the first player will take the hand.

The point of the game is to get the points which are A and 10, a total of 8.

The game ends when there are no more cards in the pack or in hand.
